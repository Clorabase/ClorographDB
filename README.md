#### Clorograph DB ~ A graph nosql database

This is another nosql database from [clorabase](htps://clorabase.tk). In this database, data is stored in form of *graphs* and *trees*. If you don't know what these are, you might not have completed **DSA** yet :-) , Fortunetly, the database is so simple to use that your knowledge of **DSA** is not required. But knowing about graphs and trees will help you to organise your data is a more good way.

## üì¢ Great announcement

Recently, The similer database [FloraDB](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/FloraDB) has migrated to *ClorographDB* and now it is a part of [Clorabase](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/Clorabase).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Implementation
![version](https://jitpack.io/v/ErrorxCode/ClorographDB.svg)
#### For Gradle
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```css
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
Add the depencdency:
```css
	dependencies {
	     implementation 'com.github.ErrorxCode:ClorographDB:JITPACK-TAG'
	}
```
#### For maven
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

Add the depencdency:
```markup
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.ErrorxCode</groupId>
	    <artifactId>ClorographDB</artifactId>
	    <version>Tag</version>
	</dependency>
```

## üìù Documentation
- ~~Javadocs~~ (Not needed)
- [Database guide](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/ClorographDB/wiki)

Every method name describes what it does, So they don't need javadocs. However, it you want to see the detailed desription, you can hover over the method name (intellij)
for seeing the javadocs comments.


## ‚öíÔ∏è Contribution
Contribution is always welcome. What you can do is you can impliment more types of **Trees** & **Graphs**. There are *interface* for both type of implimentation. **N-Array tree, Bi-directional graph, Realtional/Simple graph** are some types of *Data structure* that is already present in the database, Or you can add more fast searching algorithim if you know. You could even replace the existing one if you finds a better then that.
